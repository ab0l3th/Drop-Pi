## What is this?
This is a collection of tools that make up what we call a "Drop-Pi", primarily used as a quick placement device during a physical/social engineering penetration test. The original purpose of this device was to facilitate the automatic bypassing of NAC/802.1x implementations by placing it in-line between a machine and the switch. It quickly morphed into something more and we still have plans for this thing - so stay tuned!

## Legal Disclaimer

Usage of the Drop-Pi and subsequent scripts for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal. This is only for educational or testing purposes and can only be used where strict consent has been given. It's the end user's responsibility to obey all applicable local, state and federal laws. Developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program. Only use for educational or testing purposes.

## Special Thanks

I want to thank the entire team at [Focal Point Data Risk](https://focal-point.com/) for giving me the opportunity to research, develop, and test this device and subsequent applications that make up the Drop-Pi as a whole. Without their support and guidance, this idea would have never been possible. Thank you!!!
